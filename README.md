## The plan
#### Assignment
I choose to do the CSS Zen Garden assignment.  
For this assignment we got to choose between a restaurant menu html file or a page in a digital magazine. I choose the restaurant menu, for the sole reason that I long for a night out again.  
  
#### The following list are techniques I would like to get a closer look at:  
* Accessibilty 
* Darkmode 
* Perhaps other modes? 
* Calc()
* Custom properties
* Parallax
* grid
* Transform 
* Animate

#### Requirements:
* Responsive without media queries
* Completely accessible according to the AAA WCAG terms

## Voortgang
#### Inpsiration
Before starting, I browsed around looking for inspiration.  
In some images I found a menu on a clipboard, en though it be fun to try to create something like a flip board. Because it is in a way pretty old-school to use a clip-board menu but there lots of possibilities to make this lay-out work and fun in a digital environment.

#### Initial idea
So grabbing pen and paper, I started drawing some ideas on paper.  
I came up with a clipboard where you could flip through the menu pages, as you can see on the sketched storyboard below.
